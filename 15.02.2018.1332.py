#This is the command line to be implemented
#Scripts and 'image' will be imported from the PIL
from PIL import Image

#Import OS to command the Operating System
import os

#Note: In this case the image and the 15.02.2018.py are present in the same directory. Therefore I need not to copy the full path for the cause. 
#The image format can vary within JPG/JPEG, PNG and GIF. SVG is under process, for that you can import svglib.svglib

#The Navigator opens the picture.

#Run the Module. A new file with the specified name will be generated. Open it with any of the pdf reader. Adios!
